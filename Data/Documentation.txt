This Shiny app allows you to play around with a
normal curve in the following ways:

 o Change the mean of the displayed distribution
   to any integer between -3 and 3 inclusive

 o Change the standard deviation of the displayed
   distribution between .5 and 6 in increments of .05

 o Choose the mininum and maximum x values to show
   on the plot

 o Zoom in on a portion of the plot by brushing

The main window has two tabs.  The tab labeled
"Plot" displays the normal curve as you play around
with it.  The tab labeled "Documentation" contains
the text you are reading.

The mean and the standard deviation of the displayed
distribution can be changed by use of sliders labeled
"Mean:" and "Standard deviation:".

The minimum and maximum x values to show on the plot
can be chosen by use of the slider labeled "Input range:".
If the minimum and maximum x values are set equal to each
other, an error message will be displayed.

Brushing an area of the display will zoom in using the
minimum and maximum x values of the brushed area.  The
values for the normal curve at these x values will be
displayed.  An odd byproduct of this approach is brushing
a blank area of the display will zoom in on the part of
the normal curve corresponding to the chosen x values
--not the blank area itself.

To stop zooming and go back to the full normal curve,
click anywhere outside of the brushed area.
